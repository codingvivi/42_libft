# Libft

My (re)implementation of some of the libc functions as part of the first 42 project, libft.

Instead of writing the same functions from the piscine for the millionth time now,
I decided to look at how the profis do it,
and use
the very performant
and widely compatible
[musl libc](https://musl.libc.org/)
as a reference for a lot of my code.
A decision I don't regret,
these people are cracked!

For testing
I used [Unity](https://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity),
since it eliminated a lot of boilerplating
and copypasting
## Library Functions

The library includes the following functions:

### Libc Functions

*   `ft_isalpha`: Checks if a character is an alphabetic letter.
*   `ft_isdigit`: Checks if a character is a digit (0-9).
*   `ft_isalnum`: Checks if a character is alphanumeric (a letter or a digit).
*   `ft_isascii`: Checks if a character is a 7-bit US-ASCII character.
*   `ft_isprint`: Checks if a character is a printable character.
*   `ft_strlen`: Calculates the length of a string.
*   `ft_memset`: Fills a block of memory with a specified value.
*   `ft_bzero`: Fills a block of memory with zeroes.
*   `ft_memcpy`: Copies a block of memory from a source to a destination.
*   `ft_memmove`: Copies a block of memory, safely handling overlapping regions.
*   `ft_strlcpy`: Copies a string up to a specified size, ensuring null-termination.
*   `ft_strlcat`: Concatenates a string up to a specified size, ensuring null-termination.
*   `ft_toupper`: Converts a lowercase letter to its uppercase equivalent.
*   `ft_tolower`: Converts an uppercase letter to its lowercase equivalent.
*   `ft_strchr`: Locates the first occurrence of a character in a string.
*   `ft_strrchr`: Locates the last occurrence of a character in a string.
*   `ft_strncmp`: Compares two strings up to a specified number of characters.
*   `ft_memchr`: Locates the first occurrence of a byte in a block of memory.
*   `ft_memcmp`: Compares two blocks of memory.
*   `ft_strnstr`: Locates the first occurrence of a substring (needle) in a string (haystack), up to a specified length.
*   `ft_atoi`: Converts the initial portion of the string pointed to by `str` to an `int`.
*   `ft_calloc`: Allocates memory for an array of `nmemb` elements, each of `size` bytes, and initializes all bytes to zero.
*   `ft_strdup`: Duplicates a string by allocating sufficient memory for a copy.

### Additional Functions

*   `ft_substr`: Extracts a substring from a string, starting at `start` and of `len` characters.
*   `ft_strjoin`: Concatenates two strings (`s1` and `s2`) into a new string.
*   `ft_strtrim`: Removes any leading and trailing characters specified in `set` from `s1`.
*   `ft_split`: Splits a string `s` by a delimiter character `c` into an array of newly allocated strings.
*   `ft_itoa`: Converts an integer `n` into a null-terminated string.
*   `ft_strmapi`: Applies a function `f` to each character of the string `s` to create a new string resulting from successive applications of `f`.
*   `ft_striteri`: Applies a function `f` to each character of the string `s`, passing its index as the first argument and the character itself as the second.
*   `ft_putchar_fd`: Writes a character `c` to the given file descriptor `fd`.
*   `ft_putstr_fd`: Writes a string `s` to the given file descriptor `fd`.
*   `ft_putendl_fd`: Writes a string `s` to the given file descriptor `fd`, followed by a newline.
*   `ft_putnbr_fd`: Writes an integer `n` to the given file descriptor `fd`.

### Linked list
*   `ft_lstnew`: Creates a new list element (node) with the given `content`.
*   `ft_lstadd_front`: Adds the element `new` to the beginning of the list `lst`.
*   `ft_lstsize`: Counts the number of elements in a list.
*   `ft_lstlast`: Returns the last element of a list.
*   `ft_lstadd_back`: Adds the element `new` to the end of the list `lst`.
*   `ft_lstdelone`: Deletes a single list element, freeing its content.
*   `ft_lstclear`: Deletes and frees all elements of a list, starting from `lst`.
*   `ft_lstiter`: Applies a function `f` to the content of each element of the list.
*   `ft_lstmap`: Creates a new list by applying a function `f` to each element's content of the original list.

## Instructions

### Compilation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/codingvivi/42_libft.git
    cd 42_libft
    ```
    or whatever URL and folder name the campus repo has
2.  **Build the library:**
    To build the static library `libft.a`, run the `make` command:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    make all
    ```

    When cloning from my personal repo run
    ```bash
    make test
    ```
    to run my own battery of tests.
### Usage

To use the library in your C project:

1.  Include the header file `libft.h` in your source files:
    ```c
    #include "libft.h"
    ```

2.  When compiling your project, link the `libft.a` library:
    ```bash
    cc your_project.c -L. -lft -o your_project
    ```
    (This assumes `libft.a` is in the current directory. Adjust the path with `-L` if it's elsewhere.)

### Other Makefile Rules

-   `make clean`: Removes the object files.
-   `make fclean`: Removes the object files and the `libft.a` library file.
-   `make re`: Re-compiles the library from scratch.
-   `make test`: Compiles and runs the tests.
